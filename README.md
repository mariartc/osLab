# OSlab Exercise 3: Linux Chat over TCP/IP

This project was created by [Markos Baratsas](https://github.com/markosbaratsas) and [Maria Retsa](https://github.com/mariartc), for the purposes of the [Operationg Systems Laboratory](http://www.cslab.ece.ntua.gr/courses/compsyslab/) at [ECE NTUA](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en).

The project consists of 3 parts.

## Part 1 (unencrypted_chat): 
Simple chat implementation in C language, using sockets.
## Part 2 (encrypted_chat): 
Enriching simple chat by adding encryption (decryption) features using opensourse cryptographic device (cryptodev-linux).
## Part 3 (virtio_crypto_device): 
Implementing a paravirtualized crypto-device to be used by the chat application. This device is being developed according to the VirtIo protocol.
